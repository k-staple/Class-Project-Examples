# Class-Project-Examples
C++ projects from my first computing class (Fall 2017)

Each lab contains a readme which gives further details about the projects. For a brief summary:

Othello was created towards the end of the class, so it demonstrates more skills than some of the earlier projects. It is 
like the traditional Othello game, but was 
created without the requirement to make a piece switch teams every turn.

Labs 10 and 11 use gfx.h and gfx.o (which our instructors wrote and includes the X11 library) to display graphics. Lab 11 has several fractals created with recursion. Lab 10 shows a circle bouncing off the window's edge in 'bounce' and other abilities.

State asks for input from a file- usstates.csv in the same directory is intended to be used- and allows the user to learn 
about and update states' number of representatives. It uses a state class I created with various member functions. 

Rational displays the output of the main program, but its functions convert inputted fractions (whether on their own or as 
the result of a mathematical operatoin) to properly formatted rational numbers. 

Lab 7 includes a class for a circle and a simple driver that proves it works from when I first started learning about 
classes.

Lab 3 includes programs that calculate the greatest common denominator, polar coordinates after asking for Cartesian 
coordinates, and an interactive menu.

Lab 2 includes an interest calculator, multiplication table constructor, and a graph.

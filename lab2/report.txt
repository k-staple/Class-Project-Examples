// Kathryn Stapleton, section 1, Sept 10

This lab includes an interest calculator, multiplication table constructor, and a graph.

Graph y=15sin(x) + cos(x) + 16:

From the user's perspective, the user sees a set graph of the function
y= 15sin(x) + cos(x) + 16  with x from 0-10 increasing by .5. The program requires no input to calculate the graph.

As for how it works, the program is built around a for loop that calculates the values of y (written ynew)
for the increasing values of x. During each step, it checks if the new value of y is greater than or less than the older one.
If so, it stores that y value and the corresponding x. 

For the bar graph part, during each step of the for loop, I initialize a string back to no characaters
and an integer counter back to 0. Then, within a while loop, I set the string variable bar 
equal to a concatenation of itself and another "#." This happens as many times as 
that iteration's ynew has whole digits (as in 1 time for ynew of 1.13).

At the end, the program displays the stored (x,y) min and (x,y) max.

I checked the program by comparing it to my calculator's table of values with the same function
and increment of x. That checked out.  I counted the number of hashtags versus the value of ynew. One too many hashtags were 
printing on every line so I modified the while statement to only print another one if the counter
is less than or equal to (ynew MINUS ONE).

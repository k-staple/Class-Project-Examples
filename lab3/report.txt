// Lab 3 section 3
// Kathryn Stapleton Sept 16

This lab calculates the greatest common denominator, polar coordinates after asking for Cartesian coordinates, and the 
following menu:

From the user's perspective, the user chooses from four operations and a quitting option
by entering a number. If the user quits, a goodbye message is displayed. If not, the user is prompted to enter two numbers 
and the result of the chosen operation and two inputs is displayed. This continues until the user chooses quit.

As for how the program was built, first, the functions are declared. Then, the main function has the following in a while loop. 
The user input a number that will be stored in the variable choice.
 Then, the program has an if statment to check if the user wants to quit.
If so, a goodbye message is displayed before break is used. Otherwise, the code prompts the user for two numbers.
A follow-up if statement checked if the user inputted an integer not 1-5. In that case, the program 'continue' to the while loop's next iteration.
 Then, an if block outputs the echoed numerical choices and the appropriate result.
 This happens by calling the appropriate function within the mutually exclusive if statements. 

The functions at the bottom compute and return the result.

I verified by running the program intermittently while writing to check that it ouputted what I expected.
Then, I tried all the operations with sample numbers.
Then, I checked what happens if the second number inputted is 0 and the user chooses division.
 Once I saw on piazza that we had to reprompt for incorrect choice of operation, I checked if my code will reprompt for new numbers if numbers greater or less than 1-5 were entered.
Finally, I checked multiplication to make sure the code could handle negative numbers.
